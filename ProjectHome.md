# What is the Facepunch Lua SDK? #
The Facepunch Lua SDK is an unofficial SDK which contains the FPAPI for interfacing with Facepunch through Lua. It aims to be the primary SDK used by developers for this purpose.

# FAQ #
## Why not do this in PHP, Fortran, or (insert other language your dad used when he was a cool cat)? ##
This is the Facepunch _Lua_ SDK. Not the Facepunch _PHP_ SDK, or the Facepunch _Ruby_ SDK. You're free to port this code over to any other language, however we're not looking to do that ourselves any time soon. At the time of writing, we still have many architectural goals to complete before we could even consider doing so. The people working on the project have a lot of experience with Lua specifically due to the presence of Garry's Mod on Facepunch. We also have a lot of experience with subversion, which is why we're not on git + GitHub right now.

## How do I use this? ##
Check the /test directory for test scripts. This is the part of the SDK which we use for both testing of features and as an example dump.

## Is there any documentation? ##
We try to document the code in-file as best as possible so you understand what's going on and how everything works out, but right now we don't have a nice wiki or site dedicated to this project. We'll cover documentation with on-site examples in the future.

We're some dudes on Facepunch. If you didn't already know. Drop us a PM or something sometime.
